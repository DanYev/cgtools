Why use reForge?
====

Need to simulate large biomolecular complex? Or many?

---------------------------

.. note::

   Then reForge is the right tool. Pain-free setup of Martini+CG Protein/RNA/Lipid complexes

Python-based
------------------

Everything is included and python-based.

- **One python (actually just two) scripts is all you need:**  
  Need to run tens or hundreds of MD simulations and analyse them? reForge can do it!
  And with the press of just one button.


Accelerated C- and CUDA routines
-------------

- **Process terabytes of data like WHOOOOSH:**  
  Just look at this massive performance gain comparing to the standard python and numpy.
  ##include .png##
  And this is for a medium sized system of only ~1000 residues. 
  Imagine processing hundreds or thousands of these.

Welcome to the home page of the reForge Python package.

Overview of reForge Package
---------------------------


   The reForge source code is hosted on GitLab at: https://github.com/DanYev/reforge

The reForge Python package provides a comprehensive suite of utilities designed for MD
simulations, analysis, and data processing workflows. It features optimized mathematical routines, 
GPU‐accelerated computations, and a variety of helper tools to streamline file I/O and data manipulation. 
Developed to support advanced research projects in simulation and analysis, reForge is available for 
public use under the GNU V3 License.

What's in reForge?
------------------

In a nutshell, the key components of reForge are:

- **Python package for Molecular Dynamics:**  
  Easy to use workflows for set-up, multiple MD runs and analysis of large biomolecular systems.

- **Optimized Mathematical Routines:**  
  High-performance functions written in Cython and CUDA for computing Hessian matrices, perturbation 
  matrices, and other advanced mathematical operations.

- **GPU-Based Analysis Utilities:**  
  Tools that leverage GPU acceleration for simulation and analysis tasks, significantly reducing 
  computation times.

- **Profiling Tools:**  
  Decorators and utilities for memory and time profiling to ensure optimal performance during 
  computations.

For New Users
-------------

- **Learn the Basics:**  
  Familiarize yourself with shell scripting, git, and Python. Essential packages include 
  `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_, `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_, and `CuPy <https://cupy.dev/>`_.

- **Understand the Fundamentals:**  
  Get a grasp of object-oriented programming and high-performance computing concepts to make the 
  most of reForge’s capabilities.

- **Explore the Documentation:**  
  Skim through the available documentation and examples provided within the package to learn about 
  the various tools and workflows.

- **unit conventions:**  
  reforge uses si units throughout (e.g., angles in radians) to maintain consistency in calculations.

for developers
